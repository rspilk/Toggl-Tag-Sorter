This is the README. I am making this in about 10 seconds.

I wrote this because I use toggl to track my time at work, however in order to report this time I need to sort it into a few certain categories. I use the tags to accomplish this.

Basically, -1 gives the first tag (defaults are what i use), -2 is the other default. There are also quick methods. -q yesterday gives yesterday's time. -q monday for monday, etc.

I couldnt find anyone else who had done something like this, so I wrote my own. I hope somebody finds this useful. I am still working on this, but I figure since I was looking for something like this, perhaps someone else can find use in it.

I need to update the command line argument names, as they dont make any freakin sense. (eg, shortname for --end_time).

additionally, you can also specify custom start,stop dates/times with the arguments.

Check -h


TO RUN:
Add your toggl api token to username field ex: username = 'apikeygoesherebetweenthequotes'
Execute command with just ./toggl.py

Should find your python path unless yours is different than mine.

Questions?
